          UPDATE: The entire KJV Bible is now available onchain!!!!
          <br />
          I am almost certain that this is the first time in history that the Bible was stored directly on the
          blockchain. <br /> &mdash; Nov. 21st, 2024

            Could we put the Bible on the blockchain?

          <h3>Could “crypto” become a new way to protect scripture?</h3>
          <p>
            The blockchain could provide a decentralized and immutable record of the Bible &mdash; a way to ensure that
            the scriptures are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>unbannable</li>
            <li>unburnable</li>
            <li>unchangeable</li>
            <li>and available to all</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Making books/documents unbannable can mean that everyone has access to them &mdash; regardless of
            geopolitical or ideological restrictions. Readers all over the world could freely engage with these texts
            without fear of censorship.

          <p>
            Can not currently confirm that this properly represents The Gospels + Acts (KJV) [neither in-part, nor
            in-full]. But, that is sort of the point of this project.

            The problem with this project as it stands is that I have stored a book, and THEN I am asking for{" "}

            after the fact. Ideally I think this would be much better with a council-of-members that all vote on the
            validity of a sentence (or verse) <em>before</em> it is saved.
